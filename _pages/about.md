## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 📊 Measuring the Value of Museum Events (Capstone)
- Integrated 10+ years of ticketing, retail, donations, weather, and event data.  
- Built unified datasets & resolved cross-system inconsistencies.  
- Developed OLS & XGBoost models (R² = 0.52–0.63) to estimate revenue uplift.  
- Found: Mixed events generate **~$4.9k/day** uplift, +9% retail sales, +$63 donations.

### 🌍 Climate Time-Series Forecasting (LSTM/BiLSTM)
- Built continent-specific forecasting models using lagged, seasonal, and sine–cosine features.  
- Compared global vs regional performance; improved RMSE via BiLSTM architecture.  
- Investigated seasonality inversion, structural noise, and data quality inconsistencies.

### ✈️ US Airport Delay Optimization (Simulation)
- Built discrete-event simulation in Python (SimPy).  
- Identified gate capacity as the primary bottleneck; reduced average delay **11.5 → 1.5 min**.

### 🧮 Hybrid Financial Data System
- PostgreSQL + MongoDB architecture for **15M+ stock records**.  
- Reduced storage by 25% with Spark compression.
