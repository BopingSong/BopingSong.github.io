## Projects & Research Experience

**Measuring the Value of Museum Events: Revenue and Post-Visit Behavior**  
*Capstone, APAN S5900 — Fall 2025*  
- Analyzed 10+ years of multi-source institutional data (ticketing, retail, events, donations, weather), integrating over 188,000 visitor donation records.  
- Performed large-scale data cleaning and feature engineering to resolve cross-system inconsistencies and construct unified analytical datasets.  
- Built OLS and XGBoost models (R² = 0.52–0.63) to estimate event-driven revenue uplift while controlling for seasonality, visitor flow, and weather.  
- Identified actionable findings: mixed events generate approximately \$4.9K daily ticket uplift, a 9% increase in store sales, and \$63 higher average donations per visitor.

**Modeling and Optimization of U.S. Airport Flight Delay Management**  
*APAN 5530: Analytics for Business Operations — Summer 2025*  
- Developed discrete-event simulation models in Python (SimPy) using U.S. DOT flight data.  
- Evaluated gate and ground crew configurations, identifying gate capacity as the primary system bottleneck.  
- Reduced average post-landing waiting time for service availability from 11.5 to 1.5 minutes through optimized resource allocation.

**Can Bitcoin Be Used as an Inflation Hedge Like Gold?**  
*APAN PS 5205 — Spring 2025*  
- Led a team study examining whether Bitcoin exhibits safe-haven behavior comparable to gold during market stress.  
- Applied ARIMA time-series models, K-means clustering, and association rule mining on 2013–2025 price and volume data.  
- Found that Bitcoin lacks consistent hedging properties, informing portfolio risk and diversification strategies.

**Managing Financial Data with Hybrid Database Systems**  
*APAN 5400: Managing Data — Spring 2025*  
- Designed a hybrid data architecture integrating PostgreSQL and MongoDB to manage 15M+ financial records.  
- Improved query performance and reduced storage usage by approximately 25% through Spark-based compression.  
- Led a three-person team in database design, ETL pipeline construction, and distributed computation using Apache Spark.

**Decentralized Game Asset Trading and Options Platform**  
*APAN PS 5470: Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Analytics — Spring 2025*  
- Developed a decentralized trading system supporting NFTs and fractional NFTs with embedded options.  
- Implemented smart contracts in Solidity using ERC-20 and ERC-1155 standards; deployed via Remix and MetaMask.  
- Proposed a novel fNFT-based financial model for virtual asset economies.

**Predicting Online Advertisement Click-Through Rates**  
*APAN 5200 — Fall 2024*  
- Participated in a Kaggle competition predicting ad CTR using behavioral and content features.  
- Compared linear models, decision trees, LightGBM, and XGBoost with cross-validation.  
- Ranked 21st out of 387 competitors, balancing predictive accuracy and interpretability.

**Enhancing Workplace Mental Health Programs**  
*APAN 5300: Research Design — Fall 2024*  
- Simulated a dataset of 500 employees to evaluate counseling, mindfulness, and flexible work interventions.  
- Conducted ANOVA and linear regression analyses in R; visualized results with ggplot2.  
- Authored a full research report including literature review, hypotheses, and demographic moderation analysis.
