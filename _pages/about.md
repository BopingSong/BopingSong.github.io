  M.S. Applied Analytics,

I am interested in data-driven modeling for decision-making in complex and uncertain systems. My work focuses on how modeling assumptions, data representations, and system design choices affect inference, generalization, and reliability under distributional shift. I have experience across forecasting, causal analysis, and simulation-based modeling, with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and real-world impact. I am currently preparing for research-oriented study in data science and machine learning.
